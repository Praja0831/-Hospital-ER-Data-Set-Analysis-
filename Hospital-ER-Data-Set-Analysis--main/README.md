🏥 Hospital ER Data Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes hospital emergency room (ER) data using Power BI and Python. Dataset having more than 9.2k entry.   
The dashboard provides actionable insights into patient admissions, demographics, and trends.  

🔍 Key Insights:
Monthly admission trends 📅  
Age group distribution 👶👩‍🦳  
Department-wise admissions 🏥  
Gender and racial demographics 👨👩   
Daily & monthly admission patterns  


## Power BI Analysis

1)I have find above mentioned KPI from Hospital ER Dataset.

2)Firstly i have check that data is clean and  preprocess  for visualization or Not.

3)Create some Measures For visualization.

4)Create the columns Day, Month and Year from Patient Admission Date Column.

5)Use Day and Month Column for Daily and Monthly Trend Analysis.

6)By Using the Columns Race and Gender visualize the racial demographics by gender.

7)Department wise Patient Admission
